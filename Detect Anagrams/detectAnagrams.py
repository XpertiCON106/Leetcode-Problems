Question:
Given two strings t and s determine if they are anagrams of each other.
Anagrams are two strings that use the exact same characters.
For example “angered” and “enraged” are anagrams of each other.
However, you cannot use hashing, i.e. no hash tables or hash sets or hash maps are allowed.

Examples:
“angered”, “enraged” → true
“salad”, “dallas” → false
