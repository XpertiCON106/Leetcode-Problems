# The rotation of a linked list can be defined as an operation that makes a node k 
# the new head of the linked list, and appends each element that was before k to the 
# end of the linked list. We can call the element selected the kth element of the linked 
# list, and thus call the resulting linked list the kth rotation. 

# Write a function, which takes a Node and an integer k as itâ€™s arguments and returns a new 
# node that is the head of the kth rotation of the linked list. If the value k is longer than 
# the length of the linked list, is 0, or is negative, instead return the original linked list. 
# If the Node is None, return None. You will not be passed a circular linked list.
# You are guaranteed the linked list will have no more than 1,000,000 nodes.
