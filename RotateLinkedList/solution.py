# The rotation of a linked list can be defined as an operation that makes a node k
# the new head of the linked list, and appends each element that was before k to the
# end of the linked list. We can call the element selected the kth element of the linked
# list, and thus call the resulting linked list the kth rotation.

# Write a function, which takes a Node and an integer k as itâ€™s arguments and returns a new
# node that is the head of the kth rotation of the linked list. If the value k is longer than
# the length of the linked list, is 0, or is negative, instead return the original linked list.
# If the Node is None, return None. You will not be passed a circular linked list.
# You are guaranteed the linked list will have no more than 1,000,000 nodes.

We will use this linked list as a referece to explain my algorithm
0->1->2->3->4->5

The number is just the index, not the actual value of the nodes.

So, first we take care of the edge cases; if k == 0 or negative, just return the linked list

So if we have the linked list above, and k was 3. We know that our resulting list would linked

3->4->5->0->1->2

Here we can see, we actually have two linked list stiched together
Linked List 1: 3->4->5
Linked List 2: 0->1->2

My goal was to find these two linked list and stich them together.
To do that, I start traversing the linked list.

if we find the kth term, in this case 3, i have a child node that will be equal
to that node. So child node in this case will be 3, which follows with 4 and 5.
so the resulting linked list will be 3->4->5.

if we don't find the kth term, we go to the next node recursively and we keep check
of the head node.

once we find the kth term, we set child node equal to the kth node, and we set kth node
equal to None which makes everything from the k to len(head) node equal to None.
So the head node, in this case, becomes 0->1->2.

My recursive function returns a tuple (head, child) so after traversing in this cases
we will get the following.
child: 3->4->5
head: 0->1->2

so now we just need to add head node to the end of child node.

I use an insert method that traverses the child node until its at the last node.
then it just inserts it in.

the space complexity is O(n) because i have a child node that contains a portion of the linked list.

The time complexity is O(n) as well because first I traverse the linked list to find the kth value.
Once I find the kth value, I don't traverse it anymore. Then the i traverse from the kth node to the end
of the linked list of the child node to stich both of the linked list together. so basically traversing
through the rest of the list. So traversing through the entire linked list ONCE.

Because python has a recursion limit, i am unable to pass test 5 :(
