# Given a list of strings containing integers and arithmetic operators
# ordered by reverse polish notation, evaluate the expression.
# Valid operators are +, -, *, / .
# We will use truncated integer division here. For example, 13/6 = 2.
# For this question, you will get only +, *, -, and /, and have no invalid inputs.
# All lists will be in appropriate RPN order. If an empty list is provided, return 0.
# You are guaranteed the size of the list will not exceed 1,000,000
# Return all outputs as integers (not strings)

# How Reverse Polish Notation works
# In reverse polish notation, operators are put after the operands.
# So for example, instead of writing 3 - 4, we write 3 4 -.
# The steps to evaluating an RPN expression are as follows.

# 1. Evaluate operators left to right. Starting with the leftmost operator,
# 2. Given the operator youâ€™re currently on, apply it to the two operands directly
#    before it. Remove the operator and its operands , and replace them with the result.
# 3. Repeat step one with the next operator on the left hand side, if there is one.
#    Otherwise, the final result is your answer.

"""
So for this problem, I will be using a stack.
Basically, I go through each items in the token list.
If token items is a number, I put it in the stack.
I keep doing this until i find an operator.

If i find a operator, I pop out two number from the stack, that will get rid of the items from the stack itself.

Then i perform the actual calculation. then I update the result with the calculation and
put that result into the stack and continue my search through the token list.

I keep doing this until i have exhausted my token list.

The result will the result of the last calculation that we did.

Space complexity is O(n) since we are storing a stack as we go through the token
Time complexity is O(n) as well since we go through the token list and go through it only once.
